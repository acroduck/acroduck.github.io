			My name is Sarnaa Archie&nbsp;(pronounced Sar-nay).&nbsp;</p>

			<p><br />
			When I was 17 I sold my software business to another startup and went to work for them&nbsp;but that got old and I wanted to do something that mattered, something that made a difference. From the halls of academia, lecturing on new media, to the hallowed halls of the church shepherding teens, to the coffee houses in the highlands of East Africa and North Atlanta I make, tell stories,&nbsp;and do things that make a difference.</p>

			<p>In the cold of 2008, after paying off debt, and either giving away or selling all my stuff I boarded a plane with a group of doctors and nurses headed to Ethiopia. There I swam in the kings pool, took pictures of monkeys, became a youth mentor, and a makeshift soccer coach.</p>

			<p>When a kid in my village committed suicide because he couldn&#39;t get a drivers license to become a truck driver, I decided to do something about it. So I boarded a plane back to the states. I traveled around the country, told my story, and raised money and&nbsp;books. A year later I&nbsp;was back in Ethiopia to get started.</p>

			<p>But this second trip changed everything. I was kicked out by the government, forced to leave my new wife behind, I lost my faith, my financial backing, and abused drugs and alcohol. The set back killed something in me.</p>

			<p>Whatever it killed, however, what remained was the desire to make a difference. What it created was faith in the power of stories to transform things, a passion for telling them, an excitement for the possibilities of digital media, and the courage to go my own way, again.</p>

			<p>Now I write, and help organizations, people, and groups do and make good stuff.</p>

			<p>My name is Sarnaa Archie, I tell stories and root for you. I am a storyteller and people champion.</p>
