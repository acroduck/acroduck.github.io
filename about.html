			My name is Sarnaa Archie&nbsp;(pronounced Sar-nay).&nbsp;</p>

			<p><br />
			When I was 17 I sold my software business to another startup and went to work for them&nbsp;but that got old and I wanted to do something that mattered, something that made a difference. From the halls of academia, lecturing on new media, to the hallowed halls of the church shepherding teens, to the coffee houses in the highlands of East Africa and North Atlanta I make, tell stories,&nbsp;and do things that make a difference.</p>

			<p>In the cold of 2008, after paying off debt, and either giving away or selling all of my stuff I boarded a plane with a one way ticket to Ethiopia. There I swam in the kings pool, took pictures of monkeys, became a mentor to youth, and a makeshift soccer coach.</p>

			<p>When a kid in my village committed suicide because he couldn&#39;t get a drivers license to become a truck driver, I decided to do something about it. I boarded a plane back to the states. I traveled around the country, told my story, and raised money and&nbsp;books. A year later I&nbsp;was back in Ethiopia to get started.</p>

			<p>But this second trip changed everything. I was kicked out by the government. Newly married, and forced to leave my wife behind, I lost my faith and self medicated.</p>

			<p>I decided to keep doing what I committed to doing there. I went following a dream, a literal dream of mountains and lanky African faced boys. And decided that I would continue to dream, and adventure, and catalogue those adventures. That I would tell the stories of a thousand faceless and nameless nobodies whose lives exist in obscurity.</p>

			<p>Those we would otherwise pass over, ordinary people, imagined people, people with no dignity at all. Profiles of the rich and famous turned upside down, with a twist.</p> 
				
			<p>And continue to dream and be inspired by the songs that wake me up first thing in the morning, following them wherever they take me.</p>
			
			<p>My name is Sarnaa. I tell stories and I root for you. I am a storyteller and people champion.</p>
