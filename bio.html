				<p><b>Artist Statement & Bio</b></p>
				<p>
				For Los Angeles native and Atlanta-based self-taught artist Sarnaa Archie, his gift of expression presented early in life.<br/>
        By the time he was 10, he exhibited in museums and galleries in Japan, New York, and California, winning many awards.<br/> 
         Ever the observer, Sarnaa (/sar-nay/) found inspiration in art that was an expression of things more felt than seen:<br/>
          the primitive style drawings of Keith Haring, the colorful explorative cubism of Picasso, the illustrative style of Geoff<br/>
          McFetridge, the socially critical pop-art stylings of Andy Warhol, and the round and flat illustrative style of Ub Iwerks,<br/>
          popularized by Walt Disney. However, Jean Michele Basquiat was arguably, most influential, since, after watching a dramatization<br/>
          of the artists brief life, young Sarnaa came to fear the spiral of drug abuse that consumed Basquiat. Practical beyond his years,<br/>
          he veered far away from the pursuit of anything that felt like being an artist.<br/><br/>
         
          By age 17, Sarnaa sold a software business, became a tech investor, and was a lecturer at the University of Georgia, setting himself<br/>
          up to spend the next decade as an enterpriser and humanitarian whose interests and passions took him around the world. No matter how<br/>
          neatly this career he built fit into the world’s expectations around him, there was a void within that no open-air office could fill<br/>
          and that he could no longer ignore. In 2019, Sarnaa accepted that his continued, deliberate, and focused practice in art—visual, written,<br/>
          and auditory—were the best way to fulfill his intellectual curiosity and sense of meaning and purpose. Through his art he builds a context<br/>
          for meaningful conversation.<br/><br/>
          
          His work is informed by readings in western and eastern philosophy, broad studies in history, visual depictions of Black People in early American<br/>
          and contemporary art and media—with a particular focus on “Black Americana.” Though his subjects and themes differ from piece to piece, their focus<br/>
          tends toward broad socio-philosophical ideas of identity, humanity, and individual conscious and subconscious focus.<br/><br/>

          In his large ink on paper works, the deep-black India ink concurrently defines, reveals, and redefines a quilt of images, informed by the deep black lines,<br/>
          creating visual and cognitive dissonance. When the viewer changes her focus from the black to the white spaces (or vice-versa), an alternative conceptual world<br/>
          reveals itself within the same visual plane. Yet in his smaller ink on paper works he plays on words and images by juxtaposing known objects with seemingly unrelated words.<br/>
          The thematic interrelationships deepen and broaden, causing the viewer to reconsider any definitive conclusion about the composition’s theme and broadens our conception of<br/> 
          definition itself.<br/><br/>
          
          In contrast to these black and white pieces are the artist’s digital drawings, where depth of field takes over, focused on a principle subject, usually portraying an imagined<br/>
          stereotype or caricature of a concept. In these works, color, form, and content contrast and color block to create tension, causing the viewer to question or second guess the<br/>
          dissonance in their visceral and articulated sense of pleasure, confusion, terror, or whatever emotions the images conjure. At that moment, the viewer, moved to reckon with a<br/>
          collision of contradiction, comes face to face with the many things that we are.<br/><br/>
          
          Throughout Sarnaa’s work, the common thread is the artist’s interest in the potential of dissonance and objectivity to resolve internal conflict in the hope that it creates wholeness<br/>
          in himself and his audience.<br/>
